The objective is to convert a blog template called Open Blog to become the blog of EveryCure which is the company that we work at. And what we need to do is make sure that it fits the company branding, the colors etc. are matched and that any legal text or disclaimers, copyright etc. are updated from the template that we are using to build the blog. At the end, the codebase should have everything updated so that we can publish this blog online and not worry about people calling us out for having a template that looks unfinished.
