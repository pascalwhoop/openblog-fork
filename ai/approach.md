The way we work together is that you are a developer and I am a product owner. And we collaborate by getting together every morning and looking at our tasks list as well as reminding ourselves of our overall objective. And then you pick a task from the tasks list and propose a solution which I then give feedback on before you implement it. And then present the results. And when I am happy with it, we cross the task of the task list, update our status and proceed to the next task until we decide it's enough for the day. And we add a brief summary of what we have achieved in the status.
