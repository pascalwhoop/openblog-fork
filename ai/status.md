## Day 1

- Updated `site.config.ts` with Every Cure's information
- Updated categories in the relevant file
- Fixed the title in `index.astro`
- Updated favicon and logo images
- Derived color scheme from favicon

Progress: We've successfully customized the basic site configuration, homepage, and branding elements to reflect Every Cure's identity. We've incorporated the new logo and favicon, and identified the primary color scheme. Next steps include implementing the color scheme across the site and updating the open-graph image.
